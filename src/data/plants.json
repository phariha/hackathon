Still, if you notice brown tips on the leaves, check the chemicals in the water you provide. Your plant is sensitive to the minerals in tap water like chlorine and fluoride.

Donkey's tail is drought resistant once established, so you should water it more frequently during the spring and summer growing season, and taper off in the fall and winter months. Generally, opt for a single heavy watering each month if your plant is indoors, increasing to once every two or three weeks if itâ€™s outdoors. Check the soil with your finger to make sure the soil is dry at least an inch down before watering the plant. To aid in drainage, choose a pot with holes at its base; a terracotta or clay material can also help wick water from the soil.",

Less bright conditions will slow growth, and shady/dark areas should be avoided to keep this plant healthy.",

        "WATERING": "In ideal conditions during warmer months, you should expect to water this plant once or week or more. Make sure the soil has dried out before watering. In colder months, a lot less water is required.",

        "LIGHTING": "Indirect",
        "LIGHTING_DESCRIPTION": "The ZZ plant accommodates a pretty board spectrum of light conditions including low-light, but deep shade should be avoided for optimal growth. Too much light will be damaging, since it doesnâ€™t thrive on direct sunlight such as those found from South facing windows. Aim for North, East, or West facing windows that get good natural light.",
        "HUMIDITY": "Low",
        "WATERING": "This plant is pretty drought tolerant, and can actually survive months without water, so infrequent watering and dry soil is okay. However, heavy consistent watering will cause leaves to turn yellow before rotting the tubers. It is important to have drainage holes in your growing container to get rid of excess water. Water when soil is dry, most likely once a week.",

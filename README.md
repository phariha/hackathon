# TechTogether 2023 Hackathon

The theme for this hackathon was sustainability, which is why we created a website called Sustainify to introduce cost-effective sustainability methods that college students and younger people could implement into their day to day lives. 

On our homepage, we use HTML and CSS to create a clean and eye-catching design that introduces sustainability as the ability to maintain balance and harmony in the natural systems that support human life. It sets the tone for the rest of the website and creates excitement for what's to come. On our Why Me page, we detail how important it is for college students and Gen Z to get more involved with helping fight against climate change. This is also where our take action page comes in. 

The dropdown menu of the Take Action page has three categories. FIrst, we have the Recycling page. We started off by highlighting the importance of recycling for college students. At the end we have included a list of recyclable and non-recyclable items, empowering users to make informed choices. Moving on, we have the Transportation page. We highlighted the importance of public transportation and the effects of fossil fuels on the environment. To inform students about transportation near them, weâ€™ve included images of  alternative transportation options, making it more accessible and visually appealing. 

And last but not least, we have the explore section. We have created a search feature that allows users to find their ideal plant based on their preferences and budget. You can also filter based on the cost to make budget-friendly purchases. You can also click on each plant and see their maintenance level - as this is targeted towards students, we have made this page easy so that people can determine how committed they are to the plant of their choice. 

But why plants? Growing plants is an effortless and low maintenance job but also is a small step to improving the environment. If we ignore the small steps that can be taken to improving this larger issue of climate change, then nothing will ever improve.

In conclusion, Sustainify aims to educate users about sustainability with a focus on college students as we understand better than anyone else how difficult it can be to spend money in this economy. We want to make a difference and inspire others to join the sustainability movement.
